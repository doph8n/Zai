# Building a Neural Network from Scratch in Zig 0.14

Hey there! So you want to build a neural network from scratch in Zig 0.14? That's a fantastic project that'll teach you both about neural networks and Zig's capabilities. Here's a guide to help you navigate this journey without diving straight into code.

## Development Roadmap

### 1. Matrix Operations
Start with implementing basic matrix operations since they're the foundation of neural networks:
- Matrix creation, addition, subtraction
- Matrix multiplication (this is crucial!)
- Element-wise operations
- Transposition
- Random initialization (for weights)

Challenge: Zig doesn't have built-in matrix types, so you'll need to decide how to represent them efficiently.

### 2. Activation Functions
Implement common activation functions and their derivatives:
- Sigmoid
- ReLU
- Tanh
- Softmax (for output layer in classification)

### 3. Layer Abstraction
Create a layer abstraction that:
- Holds weights and biases
- Performs forward propagation
- Stores activations for backpropagation
- Supports different activation functions

### 4. Neural Network
Build the network that:
- Contains multiple layers
- Performs forward propagation through all layers
- Implements backpropagation
- Updates weights using gradients

### 5. Loss Functions
Implement common loss functions:
- Mean Squared Error
- Cross-Entropy Loss

### 6. Optimization Algorithms
Start with simple gradient descent, then maybe add:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Mini-batch Gradient Descent
- (Optional) More advanced optimizers like Adam

## Challenges You'll Face

1. **Memory Management**: Zig gives you control, but you'll need to be careful about allocations, especially with large matrices.

2. **Error Handling**: Use Zig's error handling to gracefully handle issues like matrix dimension mismatches.

3. **Numeric Stability**: Watch out for overflow/underflow in operations like exp() for softmax or log() for cross-entropy.

4. **Performance**: Matrix operations can be slow if not optimized. Consider using SIMD instructions for performance-critical parts.

5. **Generics**: You might want to make your network generic over numeric types (f32, f64).

## Testing Strategy

1. Start with the XOR problem - it's the "Hello World" of neural networks
2. Verify each component separately (matrix ops, activation functions)
3. Test gradient calculations with numerical differentiation
4. Compare your results with established libraries on simple problems

## Learning Progression

1. First, make it work with hardcoded values
2. Then make it configurable
3. Finally, optimize for performance

## Fun Extensions

Once your basic network is working:
- Add visualization of training progress
- Implement convolutional layers
- Add regularization techniques
- Support for saving/loading models

This is a challenging but rewarding project! The beauty of building from scratch is that you'll understand every part of the system. Start small, test frequently, and don't get discouraged if backpropagation is tricky to debug - it always is!
